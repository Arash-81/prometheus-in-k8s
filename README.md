# Monitoring domains with Prometheus in Kubernetes

### ping-bash

First, I wrote a `ping-script.sh` script that uses the ping command to ping domains provided in the `ping-urls` config map every 30 seconds. The script saves the data in a shared file called `/data/ping.txt`, which I created a volume for this in the deployment YAML file.

> [!NOTE]
> To prevent race conditions, I created a `lock` file to set a mutex for preventing read/write access by Python and Bash.

### pyExporter

This code uses the Prometheus client library to export a gauge metric called my_inprogress_requests. The metric tracks the value for each domain and type.

The code first starts a Prometheus HTTP server on port `8000`. Then, it enters a loop where it checks the `/data/lock` file. If the file contains the string "mutex is 1", then the code executes the `ping_values()` function. This function reads the data from the `/data/ping.txt` file and exports the metrics to Prometheus. After the `ping_values()` function is executed, the code writes the string "mutex is 0" to the `/data/lock` file and sleeps for 30 seconds.

If the `/data/lock` file does not contain the string "mutex is 1", then the code sleeps for 5 seconds.

### ping-deployment

This Kubernetes deployment YAML file deploys two containers:

- A `ping-bash` container that runs the `ping-script.sh` script to ping domains provided in the `ping-urls` config map.
- A `exporter` container that runs the `pyExporter.py` script to export metrics from the `ping-bash` container to Prometheus.

The `ping-bash` container mounts two volumes:

- The `config-volume`, which is a config map that contains the list of domains to ping.
The `emptydir-volume`, which is an empty directory that is used to store the results of the ping commands.

The `exporter` container mounts the `emptydir-volume` volume, which is used to store the metrics exported by the `pyExporter.py` script.

### Service Discovery

- To add an exporter to Prometheus service discovery, I wrote a service monitor in `servicediscovery.yaml`. For more details, see [this](https://fabianlee.org/2022/07/07/prometheus-monitoring-a-custom-service-using-servicemonitor-and-prometheusrule/) link.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It would be better to create a headless service and then use the same label, such as `monitoring: enabled`, in the deployment, headless service, and service monitor. Check out the headless directory.


- You can also enable auto service discovery by adding values during installation with Helm: click [here](https://fabianlee.org/2022/07/08/prometheus-monitoring-services-using-additional-scrape-config-for-prometheus-operator/).
